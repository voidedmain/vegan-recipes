# Vegan Recipes
Collection of recipes that I like to make.

> They involve some cooking, but are the lowest effort for me, which means I try to prep as much as possible or buy canned stuff.

* [Pasta Pomodoro](https://github.com/voidedmain/vegan-recipes/blob/main/pasta-pomodoro.md)
* [Coconut Curry Noodles](https://github.com/voidedmain/vegan-recipes/blob/main/coconut-curry-noodles.md)
