### Step 1: Mashed Potatoes

- Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the butter, milk, and salt. Mash, combining everything together until smooth.

### Step 2: Stew
- Place oil in a medium pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, then add the onion. Sauté for 6 minutes or until the onions are soft and translucent.
- Add the mushrooms, carrots, and garlic to the pot and sauté for another 2 minutes.
- Add the broth, tomato paste, soy sauce, and lentils, and give a quick stir. Increase the heat to high until boiling.
- Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.

### Step 3: Set up and baking
- Test the stew, salt and pepper to taste, then add spinach and simmer for another 5 minutes or until the spinach is wilted.
- Fill your oven dish 3/4 of the way with stew. Fill the last ¼ with mashed potatoes.
- Crush the Pringles into crumbs, and sprinkle them over the top of the potatoes. Spray with cooking oil.
- Bake for 10 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned
